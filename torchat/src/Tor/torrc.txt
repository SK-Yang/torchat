# the following is a dirty workaround for the 15 minutes problem:
# hidden service descriptors are cached 15 minutes, so after
# a restart of tor we are not reachable for 15 minutes.
# Using always the same introduction points makes even old 
# and stale descriptors still work. I am still searching
# for a better solution.
