## torrc.txt
##
## This is the configuration file for the portable instance of Tor.
## You will only have to make changes here if you want to run a second
## instance of TorChat on the same machine. See the HowTo.

## If you want to run multiple instances, change all the port numbers.
## Remember to change them in torchat.ini [tor_portable] and [client] too.
## IMPORTANT: Don't change the FIRST 11009 in HiddenServicePort,
## this is the port INSIDE the tunnel. You must change the second one. 
SocksPort 11109
ControlPort 11119
HiddenServiceDir hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 11009 127.0.0.1:11009

## where should tor store it's cache files
DataDirectory tor_data

AvoidDiskWrites 1
TunnelDirConns 1
PreferTunneledDirConns 1
LongLivedPorts 11009

## this short timeout results in avoiding extremely slow nodes
CircuitBuildTimeout 10

## the following is a dirty workaround for the 15 minutes problem:
## hidden service descriptors are cached 15 minutes, so after
## a restart of tor we are not reachable for 15 minutes.
## Using always the same introduction points makes even old 
## and stale descriptors still work. I am still searching
## for a better solution.
HiddenServiceNodes moria1,moria2,tor26

## turning off SaveLogging will leave sensitive information on your disk
## the built in default is save logging turned on (set to 1).
## so don't remove the # from that line unless you need it
## and remember to put it in again, after you are done.
#Log info File tor.log
#SafeLogging 0
