         <title>Version 0.9.9.109 is out</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-source-0.9.9.109.zip</link>
         <description>Version 0.9.9.109 is out. I have made some changes in the way and the order
         in which buddies on the list are connected. New in this version is support for a configuration file.
         You can now use an already running tor proxy in your network by specifying adress and port
         numbers (you mus also configure a hidden service on this proxy). Unfortubetely I hit the quota 
         and am still waiting for Google to increase my limit until I can upload the windows binary.</description>
